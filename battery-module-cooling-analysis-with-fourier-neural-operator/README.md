# Battery Module Cooling Analysis with Fourier Neural Operator

This example demonstrates applying a Fourier Neural Operator [1] to heat analysis of a 3D battery module.

## Setup

Run the example by running [`example.mlx`](./example.mlx).

## Requirements

Requires
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (R2025a or newer)
- [Deep Learning Toolbox&trade;](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)
- [Partial Differential Equation Toolbox&trade;](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/pde.html)
- [Parallel Computing Toolbox&trade;](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) (for training on a GPU)
